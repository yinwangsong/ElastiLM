First, calculate the amount of information contained in each sentence, and remove sentences with less information. 2. Next, further condense the text by removing stop words, unnecessary punctuation, and redundant expressions. Refine the content while ensuring that all key information is retained. Let's do it step by step.", "user_prompt": ""},

    "4":{"system_prompt": "You are an excellent linguist and very good at compressing passages into short expressions by removing unimportant words, while retaining as much information as possible.", "user_prompt": "Compress some text to short expressions, and such that you (GPT-4) can reconstruct it as close as possible to the original. Unlike the usual text compression, I need you to comply with the 5 conditions below: 1. You can ONLY remove unimportant words. 2. Do not change the order of words. 3. Do not change the original words, e.g. 'asking'->'ask' is NOT OK, 'current'->'now' is NOT OK. 4. Do not use abbreviations or emojis, e.g. 'without'->'w/o' is NOT OK, 'as soon as possible'->'ASAP' is NOT OK. 5. Do not add new words or symbols, this is very important. For example, 'dedicate 3 hours to each chapter'->'3 hours/chapter' is NOT OK because you add new token '/', just compress it into '3 hours each chapter'. '30 eggs plus 20 eggs equals 50 eggs'->'30+20=50' is also NOT OK becuase you add new symbols + and =, just compress it into '30 plus 20 equals 50'. \nCompress the origin aggressively by removing words only. Compress the origin as short as you can, while retaining as much information as possible. \nIf you understand, please compress the following text: \n{text_to_compress}\nThe compressed text is: "}
